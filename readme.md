#Send a song to your friend through a phone call

Last week we sponsored [The Next Web hackathon](http://thenextweb.com/conference/usa/hack-battle) in NYC. We met a developer, Herb, who had an idea to use the Deezer API to send a song to a friend over the phone. We couldn't get it to work that weekend, but now we figured it out and I want to share with you how to manipulate the AudioStreams in the Sinch JS SDK. So, here you go [Ivo](https://twitter.com/ilukac)!

## Preparation
1. [Sign up](#signup) for a Sinch account
2. Download the JS SDK from [http://sinch.com/download/](https://www.sinch.com/downloads/#downloads-javascript)
3. Click 'create new app'
4. Name your app, and click 'create'
5. Take note of your app key and secret, you will need them in a few minutes

## Time to Code
First, add your favorite song to the folder. I am adding [Something New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhJSsX5AKPI) by Axwell and Ingrosso, and naming it `somethingnew.m4a`

Open up `index.html` and add an audio element to the page just under the incoming tag:

```
<audio id="song" src='somthingnew.m4a'></audio>
```

Open up the `SinchPSTNsample/PSTNSample.js`, and enter your app key on line 24:

```
sinchClient = new SinchClient({
	applicationKey: 'your appkey',
	capabilities: {calling: true},
	//supportActiveConnection: true, /* NOTE: This is only required if application is to receive calls / instant messages. */ 
	//Note: For additional logging, please uncomment the three rows below
	onLogMessage: function(message) {
		console.log(message);
	},
});
```
##Add mediastream with two channels
I want to play the song and be able to speak to my friend at the same time. The starting point for all HTML5 sound is the audio context, so letâ€™s grab that first:

```
/*** add your own mix stream***/
var audioCtx = new AudioContext();
```

Next, we want to create a dynamics compressor; this will level the volume on the tracks so you hear the song and the speech. For more info about this see [http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#DynamicsCompressorNode](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#DynamicsCompressorNode)

```
var compressor = audioCtx.createDynamicsCompressor();
```

Next, create a source for the song and the microphone and hook it up to a media destination:

```
//this will be the stream we broadcast in our call.

var destination = audioCtx.createMediaStreamDestination(); 
var song = audioCtx.createMediaElementSource($('audio#song')[0]);
song.connect(compressor);

// get access to the mic, and connect that to the compressor
navigator.getUserMedia({video: false, audio: true}, function(stream) {
	var mic = audioCtx.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
	mic.connect(compressor);
	compressor.connect(destination);
	
}, function(error) {
		console.log(error);
});
```

Next, we need to change the call function to broadcast our custom stream instead of just hooking up to the microphone.

Change `call = callClient.callPhoneNumber()` to this:

```
call = callClient.callPhoneNumber($('input#phoneNumber').val(), {}, destination.stream);
```

Now, we want to start playing the song as soon as the other party answers. In `onCallEstablished` add 

```
$('audio#song').trigger("play");
```

and in `onCallEnded` add

```
$('audio#song').trigger("stop");
```

When running this, remember to fully quit Chrome and start with `--allow-file-access-from-files` like so:


**Windows**

```
path/to/chrome yourfilename.html --allow-file-access-from-files
```


**Mac**

```
open -a path/to/chrome yourfilename.html --args --allow-file-access-from-files
```
